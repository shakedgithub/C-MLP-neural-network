# C-MLP-neural-network
# This project implements a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network in C++. It includes:

# Matrix Class: Provides operations like transposition, dot products, and Gaussian elimination.
# Activation Functions: Implements ReLU and Softmax activation functions.
# Dense Layer Class: Handles matrix transformations and activation function integration.
# Neural Network Architecture: Builds an MLP capable of performing classification tasks, integrating multiple layers and activations.
# The project emphasizes efficient matrix operations and clean code, making it suitable for machine learning experiments.
